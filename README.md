## About the App
______

 Deployed:
 - [The LOdown](https://lo-down.herokuapp.com/)

The LOdown is an app dedicated to my two dogs, Lucy and Oscar (LO).
Both dogs have had numerous seizures in the last few years and to log them, we've been using the built in notes app on our phones. This has not been efficient or helpful in terms of data organization. This app will allow us to now view the health events, seizures specifically, in an organized way. We are able to input and keep the data separate, while still having a dashboard with both pets.
